        <h2>Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>My name is Madison DeCamillis, but typically I go by Maddie. I am 18 years young and am currently attending The University of Florida. I am a junior majoring in Telecommunication with an outside concentration of general business. I am originally from Florida and grew up on the East Coast in the small town of New Smyrna Beach. I put my family and faith above everything. I also value expressing myself and have a wide variety of passions.</p>
        
        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>I spend a lot of my free time focusing on fitness, writing, blogging, and photography. I keep a health and fitness blog to help promote a healthy lifestyle. I also enjoy traveling, particularly to tropical locations, and do a considerable amount of beach photography in my spare time. My interests include health and fitness, world news, traveling, fashion, art, and music. I participate in many outdoor activities such as running, surfing, snowboarding, and yoga. I have a good fundamental skill set to offer which includes but is not limited to leadership and customer service. I am also very savvy with social networking.</p>
        
        <h2>Goals and Ambitions</h2>
            <p>I am a pre-law student, and hope to attend law school upon attaining my bachelors in Telecommunication. I aspire to work in either the fashion industry as well as modeling. Film production is also an area of interest for me. I am a dedicated, hard-working, and innovative self-starter seeking work in these fields. I am a quick learner and take direction well, with lots of ideas and energy to offer a productive team.</p>
        
        <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>I am passionate about traveling and experiencing different places and all they have to offer. I hope my work will take me places and keep me moving around because it fascinates me. Some interesting places I have already visited include California, Hawaii, The British Virgin Islands, and The Cayman Islands. I take a lot of pride in my photography and spend a great deal of time capturing every beautiful place I can on film. Although I am comfortable behind the lens of the camera I also practice being in front of it as well. I recently started traveling for acting and modeling to places like Panama City.</p>
